### Project Name: MindMate AI 
## Hackathon problem statement
# Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness
Design an AI‑powered, confidential, and empathetic mental wellness solution that supports and guides youth in overcoming stigma and accessing help.
# Challenge
Mental health remains a significant societal taboo in India, creating a formidable barrier for young adults and students seeking support. Amidst intense academic and social pressures, these individuals often lack a confidential, accessible, and non-judgmental outlet to address their mental health concerns. The existing landscape of professional mental healthcare is often out of reach due to high costs, limited availability, and the pervasive social stigma associated with seeking help.
# Objective
Leverage Google Cloud's generative AI to create innovative and impactful solutions that address the mental wellness needs of Indian youth. Participants are encouraged to think beyond traditional approaches and design systems, applications, or platforms that can serve as a supportive resource. Solutions should aim to promote emotional well-being, provide accessible information, and help destigmatize mental health discussions in a culturally sensitive manner.
## Plan
Perfect Aparna 🌸 I got you. Since you don’t want to spend time learning from scratch and we have a tight 21 Aug → 10 Sept window, I’ll design a hand-held, error-proof roadmap where:
You focus only on concept + content + presentation,


I’ll handle giving you exact code, commands, steps,


We’ll use only free, stable, tested tools (no midway errors that waste 10 days).



🚀 21 Aug – 10 Sept Full Plan (Daily Breakdown)
Phase 1 – Foundation & Setup (21 Aug – 23 Aug)

Install Streamlit, Firebase SDK, Google Gemini SDK.


Create GitHub repo (to share code between your team).


Set up Streamlit Hello World (I’ll give code, just run).
 👉 End of Day: You’ll have a blank web app running on localhost:8501.


22 Aug (Day 2)

Store moods in Firebase.
 👉 End of Day: Moods saving in DB.


25 Aug (Day 5)

Breathing timer (animated countdown).


Positive affirmation generator (AI or pre-stored).
 👉 End of Day: Games page ready.

Add Daily Challenge System (AI suggests 1 small task daily, e.g., “Take 10 min walk”).
 👉 End of Day: Challenges working.


29 Aug (Day 9)
Add Profile Page → shows username, streak, mood stats, chatbot history.
 👉 End of Day: Personalized profile ready.



Phase 3 – Polish & Deploy (30 Aug – 2 Sept)

30 Aug (Day 10)
Style app with custom CSS → pastel cute theme.


Add logo + app name everywhere.


31 Aug (Day 11)
Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Free Hosting).


Share live link with team.


1 Sept (Day 12)
Test with multiple users.


Fix any UI glitches.


2 Sept (Day 13)

Add screenshots of app.



Phase 4 – Hackathon Prep (3 Sept – 10 Sept)
🔹 Goal → Judges’ WOW effect.
3 Sept (Day 14)
Create short demo video (screen recording with voiceover).


4–7 Sept
Practice pitch.


Add extra “wow” features if time (e.g., AI journal, calming background music).


8–10 Sept
Final polish.


Submission on 10th.



🛠 Tech Stack (Simple + Free)
Frontend + Backend → Streamlit (Python).


AI Chatbot & Affirmations → Google Gemini API (free credits).


Database → Firebase Firestore (free).


Deployment → Streamlit Cloud (free).


Graphs → Matplotlib / Plotly.


Games/Challenges → Streamlit widgets.



🌟 How Our Solution Fits the Problem Statement
Problem: Youth & students face mental health stigma + lack of engaging tools.


Our Solution:
 ✅ Empathetic AI chatbot (judgment-free support).
 ✅ Mood tracker + streaks (self-awareness + motivation).
 ✅ Games + challenges (makes mental health fun).
 ✅ Completely free & accessible (web-based, no downloads).



🔥 Why It’s Different from Others
Most mental health apps = heavy, clinical, boring → users drop off.


Ours = light, fun, game-like, streak system like Duolingo, but for mental health.


Judges will love the mix of serious impact + fun gamification.
